<!--
Starting with any positive integer, replace the number by the sum of the squares of its digits,
and repeat the process until the number equals 1 (where it will stay),
or it loops endlessly in a cycle which does not include 1.
Those numbers for which this process ends in 1 are happy numbers,
while those that do not end in 1 are unhappy numbers (or sad numbers)".
Write a JavaScript program to find and print the first 5 happy numbers.
